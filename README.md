Welcome to my Audio Programming Library!

This folder contains a bunch of coding examples of various basic audio processing functions. I collected these into a library after working through many similar examples from "The Audio Programming Book". 

Note: Almost all of these examples make use of the portsf library. This is included within each example so there should be no need to download anything external for it to work. However, these were created on an Apple Native Silicon chip so it won't work with any intel based macs or windows.

Instructions: If you are unfamiliar with using terminal programs, this will instructions for using the examples.

    1. Open your terminal application and using the 'cd' command, navigate to the folder containing the program you wish to run
    2. type 'make' into the terminal, this will compile the program into an executable file
    3. The executable file should be seen in the folder.
        To run, type './programname' along with the required arguments
        If you are unsure of the arguments needed, either check the README file, 
        or run the program and it will also give you the usage arguments
